# US-visa-appointment-notifier

This is forked from [theoomoregbee/US-visa-appointment-notifier](https://github.com/theoomoregbee/US-visa-appointment-notifier) (thanks [theoomoregbee](https://github.com/theoomoregbee) for creating it!!).

I made some adjustments to fit on what I wanted, you can check the differences [here](https://github.com/theoomoregbee/US-visa-appointment-notifier/compare/main...jluiz20:US-visa-appointment-notifier:main), but the main ones are:

- changed time interval from milliseconds to minutes (I wanted to check every 15 minutes)
- added a sleep range (between env var `SLEEP_HOUR` and `WAKEUP_HOUR`) as I didn't want to get emails during night
- closed the browser after each check (as I am using a bigger time internal, made more sense close it and always log in)
- ignore errors (catch and retry on next interval) (page can be in maintenance, for example)

## original readme

This is just a script I put together to check and notify me via email ([MailGun](https://www.mailgun.com/)) when there's an earlier date before my initial appointment date. It doesn't handle **rescheduling**.

```log
$ npm start
=====>>> Step: starting process with 250 tries left
=====>>> Step: logging in

[{"date":"2023-02-08","business_day":true},{"date":"2023-04-26","business_day":true},{"date":"2023-10-11","business_day":true}]

```

## How it works

- Logs you into the portal
- checks for schedules by day
- If there's a date before your initial appointment, it notifies you via email
- If no dates found, the process waits for set amount of seconds to cool down before restarting and will stop when it reaches the set max retries.

> see `config.js` or `.env.example` for values you can configure

## Configuration

copy the example configuration file exampe in `.env.example`, rename the copied version to `.env` and replace the values.

### MailGun config values

You can create a free account with <https://www.mailgun.com/> which should be sufficient and use the provided sandbox domain on your dashboard. The `MAILGUN_API_KEY` can be found in your Mailgun dashboard, it starts with `key-xxxxxx`. You'll need to add authorised recipients to your sandbox domain for free accounts
